# Swiss-Manager Fixtures

Place ten Swiss-Manager sample files in this directory, named `sm_01.xls` through `sm_10.xls` (or `.xlsx`).

These files are used by the Playwright staging suite tagged with `@swiss`. Until the real fixtures are added, the tests will detect the missing files and skip automatically.
